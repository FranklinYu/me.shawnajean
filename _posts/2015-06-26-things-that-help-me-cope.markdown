Some days I conquer the world and help the people around me, and others I’m lucky if I changed out of my robe or ate something more than an avocado.

I’m on meds. I’m in therapy. I read blogs. I read books. I take online quizzes. And focus on my happiness. I read about the latest ‘breakthroughs’. And I keep going around in circles.

I’ve recently found myself on an upward trajectory. So many things have changed lately that it’s hard to say what has caused it. But I thought I’d share some things that at the very least break through my fog on a daily basis.

1. [The Unapologetic Fat Girl’s Guide to Exercise and Other Incendiary Acts](http://www.amazon.com/Unapologetic-Girls-Guide-Exercise-Incendiary/dp/1607742861/) – I haven’t finished it yet. I don’t even know what I was looking for when I found it. But it has jumpstarted a really healthy reframing of exercise and why to do it.
2. [The Mindfulness and Acceptance Workbook for Anxiety](http://www.amazon.com/Mindfulness-Acceptance-Workbook-Anxiety-Commitment/dp/1572244992/) – I also haven’t finished this yet. And I know the idea of sitting through your anxiety is scary as hell when you’re well acquainted with panic attacks. The reading is easy. It doesn’t feel like work. And most importantly, it pulls me through that fog.
3. [Strong Inside / Out](http://stronginsideout.com/) – An exercise website built by someone who has depression. She writes great articles about balancing mental health and the community is super supportive.
4. [Happify](http://www.happify.com/) – I love the little game Uplift here. Not in a ‘play it forever’ way, but it’s… uplifting. They have lots of different ‘tracks’ that help you reflect on and learn about different things that might be holding you back from happiness.
5. [My Drunk Kitchen: A Guide to Eating, Drinking, and Going with Your Gut](http://www.amazon.com/My-Drunk-Kitchen-Eating-Drinking/dp/0062293036/) – This one is just a healthy reminder that everyone’s a fuck up. I get real down on myself for not being the ‘perfect adult’. But Hannah Hart makes nachos out of saltines.
6. [Yes Please](http://www.amazon.com/Yes-Please-Amy-Poehler/dp/0062268341/) – Take this as a reminder to find something you enjoy. I will always have a sweet spot for outspoken funny women who hold all the cards. Where’s your sweet spot?
7. [Secret Garden: An Inky Treasure Hunt and Coloring Book](http://www.amazon.com/Secret-Garden-Inky-Treasure-Coloring/dp/1780671067/) – There are some other mindfulness coloring books as well. I definitely recommend it. Color everything the wrong colors if you want. Or the right colors. Or draw your own pictures. It’s been a great way to break a panic cycle.

If you’re struggling, I hope something here helps you. Or, at the very least, that this post makes you feel less alone.

<small>I provide Amazon links here because they’re easy. I actually read almost all of my books through my library’s ebook app. If you buy any of these books, I encourage you to [purchase them through your local bookshop](http://www.indiebound.org/indie-store-finder).</small>
