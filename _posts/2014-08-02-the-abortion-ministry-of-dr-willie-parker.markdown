> [“The last thing I want to say is a lot of times when you come, there might be protesters. There are people that are going to be telling you that what you’re doing is wrong. It’s immoral. That you can’t be a Christian. That you’re going to hell. And a lot of women that bothers. Because there are women here who also have a religious belief, who also feel like they’re Christians.”](http://www.esquire.com/features/abortion-ministry-of-dr-willie-parker-0914)

What I tell them is that doesn’t make you a hypocrite. You can never say what you will do until you’re in the situation, and Christians get in jacked-up situations, too.](http://www.esquire.com/features/abortion-ministry-of-dr-willie-parker-0914)

There’s nothing immoral about taking care of your health. There’s nothing immoral about making the decision to not become a parent before you want to become one. There’s more than one way to understand religion and spirituality and God. I do have belief in God. That’s why I do this work. My belief in God tells me that the most important thing you can do for another human being is help them in their time of need.”](http://www.esquire.com/features/abortion-ministry-of-dr-willie-parker-0914)

There are so many things to be said about the undermining of *Roe v. Wade*. From the scientific misinformation to the mandated lies, forced ultrasounds, and extra “safety” precautions like fire closets and admitting privileges – none of it is necessary. Making abortions more painful and traumatizing will not make them more rare.

Just, guys, be like human beings. Show compassion and care for people. You don’t need to agree with a person’s decisions in order to be a shoulder to cry on and a friend to lean on. Whether you’re religious or not, there is always space for empathy and kindness for those who are in pain.
