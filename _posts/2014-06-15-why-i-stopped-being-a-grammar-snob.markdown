excerpt: The way people speak and write is based on a lot of factors. Geography, for one. The various communities you belong to are also a big influence. We’re all fluent in more than one english, for example the language of our peer group and the language of our parents’ generation.

> [The way people speak and write is based on a lot of factors. Geography, for one. The various communities you belong to are also a big influence. Most of us belong to several communities and speak a little differently in the context of each one, whether that community is found at work, on a sports team, in a particular ethnic group, or in a religious community. We’re all fluent in more than one english, for example the language of our peer group and the language of our parents’ generation.](https://medium.com/@mrooolf/why-i-stopped-being-a-grammar-snob-aac6634d79af)

> [And then there are the two factors that have possibly the biggest impact on how we use language: education and socioeconomic status. When you judge people for what you consider to be poor grammar, **you’re judging them for not being as good as you at something that might be a challenge because they didn’t have the advantages or experience you did**. Maybe they haven’t had the luxury of worrying about their grammar. Maybe their use of language is right in line with their community. Maybe you’re just being a pedantic, prescriptivist jerk.](https://medium.com/@mrooolf/why-i-stopped-being-a-grammar-snob-aac6634d79af)
