I’m revamping the blog. I’m not sure how many of you are following me for the specific things I post, and how many of you landed here from my frequent posting in the forums, but I hope you’ll like the change.

The struggles of oppression will still come up. I still feel passionate about that. But I also need to see some happiness in the darkness. And seek the light in the disappointments.

I hope that I can balance the difficult with the art. 🙂
