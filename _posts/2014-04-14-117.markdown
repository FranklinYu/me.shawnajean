If you believe in equality for all and try to treat everyone equally it can be difficult to understand the strong impact of things like microaggressions and slighting language. Thinking about this stuff can be exhausting, I know it can.

I know this kind of working environment is possible and exists and not just a theoretical reality and I know that because I work there. And even though it feels magical it’s actual not magic. It’s a practical reality created by my teammates.](http://figure53.com/notes/2014-03-27-working-for-a-unicorn/)
