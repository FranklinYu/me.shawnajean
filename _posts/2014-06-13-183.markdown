Loving [CoSupport’s Manifesto](http://cosupport.com/manifesto/ "CoSupport's Manifesto") as a focusing force in support work. Working people-first is a really high priority for me in life. Customers, coworkers, friends, audience. The best way to work for your people is to put your people first.

Some highlights:

> Customers deserve better. They deserve your time and attention and empathy.

> Feedback is the sound a microphone makes when it gets too close to a speaker. Is that noise what you call your customer’s ideas?

> Stop saying no and start saying maybe.

> Use better language. Mean what you say and say what you feel.

> Feature requests aren’t annoying, they prove someone likes what you built and they want to use it more. Stop being so defensive.

> Thank your customers profusely.

> Stop apologizing for the inconvenience. Say you’re sorry and mean it.

> Go big with service or go home.
