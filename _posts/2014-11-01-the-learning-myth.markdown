excerpt: Researchers have known for some time that the brain is like a muscle; that the more you use it, the more it grows. They’ve found that neural connections form and deepen most when we make mistakes doing difficult tasks rather than repeatedly having success with easy ones.

Anyone who thinks they’re “not a math person” or “just don’t understand chemistry” should read this. You’ve been duped. The struggle is the point. I’m so grateful everyday that I went to both a high school and college that embraced critical thinking and challenged me more than reaffirming.
