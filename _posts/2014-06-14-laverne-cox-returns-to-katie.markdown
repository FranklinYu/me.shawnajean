excerpt: Then Couric moved on to what a lot of us were waiting for. She told Cox, the “last time you were here, I got a lot of flack because I asked about the physical process” of being trans. **She then admitted that the “flack” was appropriate**, and she now understands that it’s troubling for trans people to hear those kinds of questions, because too often it’s the focus of all conversations they have with cis people and that for many trans people, the physical aspect isn’t really that big a deal.

She told Cox, the “last time you were here, I got a lot of flack because I asked about the physical process” of being trans. **She then admitted that the “flack” was appropriate**, and she now understands that it’s troubling for trans people to hear those kinds of questions, because too often it’s the focus of all conversations they have with cis people and that for many trans people, the physical aspect isn’t really that big a deal. She wanted to show that you can learn to do better and to allow Cox to highlight the trans issues that are actually important. **Cox said that she appreciates Couric’s “willingness to learn out in public,” that “we have to allow ourselves to be vulnerable and not always right” in public.** Couric agreed and said that she wants to use her last show with Cox as a teachable moment [not] only for herself, but also for others. Then Couric really stepped up and instead of asking inappropriate questions, talked almost exclusively about important trans issues.](http://www.autostraddle.com/laverne-cox-returns-to-katie-shows-how-to-do-a-teachable-moment-right-240983/)
