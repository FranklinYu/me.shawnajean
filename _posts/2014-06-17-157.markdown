> [Women who have experienced this can recognize that placating these men is a rational choice, **a form of self-defense to protect against setting off an aggressor**. But to male bystanders, it often looks like a warm welcome, and that helps to shift blame in the public eye from the harasser and onto his target, who’s failed to respond with the type of masculine bravado that men more easily recognize. Two weeks before the murders, Louis C.K.—who has always recognized pervasive male violence against women in his stand-up—spelled out how this works in an episode of *Louie*, where he recalls watching a man and a woman walking together on a date. “He goes to kiss her, and she does an amazing thing that women somehow learn how to do—she hugged him very warmly. **Men think this is affection, but what this is is a boxing maneuver.**” Women “are better at rejecting us than we are,” C.K. said. “**They have the skills to reject men in the way that we can then not kill them**.”](http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2014/05/_yesallwomen_in_the_wake_of_elliot_rodger_why_it_s_so_hard_for_men_to_recognize.html)
