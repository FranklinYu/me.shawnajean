title: None of this is okay.
---


I’ve written this post over and over in my head. I’ve had imaginary discussions with myself about whether I should post it. And I’ve retreated from social media to avoid flooding myself and triggering my anxiety and becoming immobilized.

But in my heart, I believe silence is complacency. Silence is harmful. Silence in the face of injustice is harmful.

And so I’m here. I’m writing this. I’m reading and listening. And I’m trying to balance self care and my anxiety and depression with the tremendous guilt I feel for not being able to be a louder voice right now.

Stepping away is **not** what I want to do. But some days its all that I can do.

Every article I share is read, and vetted, and fact checked. And it is so hard to fact check, over and over, the end of so many black lives at the hands of police officers. It is so hard to hear the excuses in one case addressed in a new one, only to have those same voices manifest new excuses. It is soul crushing for me.

The system is rigged. It is built to keep black people down and lift white faces up. It is built to maintain poverty and multiply wealth.

And while I can barely handle my Facebook feed, much less my usual vetting process to post things here, I can not be silent. This is **not** okay.

*To my friends who share in my struggles with mental illness, I certainly haven’t found a good balance yet. Self care is important. Do what you can when you can.*
